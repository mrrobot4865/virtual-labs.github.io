            <span class="v70_7"> Circuit analysis is the study of how electrical components like resistors, capacitors, and batteries interact in a circuit.By using mathematical techniques, we can predict the voltage, current, and power at different points in the circuit. </span>

            <span class="v73_10">We study how different types of information (signals) are processed and analyzed by systems. Signals can be anything from sound waves, like music, to electrical signals in your phone. Systems are tools or processes that manipulate these signals, like an equalizer adjusting sound levels. </span>
            <span class="v73_11">We study of electronic circuits that handle digital signals, which are signals that have only two states: on (1) and off (0). These circuits form the foundation of  modern gadgets. By using components like logic gates and microprocessors, digital electronics can perform complex calculations and processes quickly and accurately.</span>
            <span class="v73_15">It deals with controlling and converting electrical power efficiently using electronic devices. It's like managing the electricity that powers your home, phone, or electric car, ensuring it's used safely and effectively. Devices like inverters and converters help change electricity from one form to another, such as converting AC from the wall outlet to DC for your laptop.</span></div>
